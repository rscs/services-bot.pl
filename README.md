# services-bot.pl

This is a very simple DALnet services PERL script I wrote back in 1997 to manage a private network I ran.

This many years later, I cannot claim it will work or even connect to any ircd server.

I was a very young, green coder at the time, so pardon any obvious coding or logic mistakes.
